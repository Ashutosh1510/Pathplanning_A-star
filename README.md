# **Implementation of A-star Algorithm for a Mobile Robot**
The goal of the project is to implement A* algorithm to find a path between start and end point on a given map for a mobile robot.
## A* Algorithm:
This Algorithm is the advanced form of the BFS algorithm (Breadth-first search), which searches for the shorter path by finding the least cost from the starting point to the ending point. It is a complete as well as an optimal solution for solving path and grid problems.

# Dependencies
1. Python3
2. Opencv
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. argparse

## Steps to Run the code

### **Parameters**
- radius: Radius of the robot
- clearance: Clearance for the Obstacle
- theta_Angle: Orientation of the robot at each node
- Xs: X-coordinate of the starting point of the robot
- Ys: y-coordinate of the starting point of the robot
- Xg: X-coordinate of the goal point of the robot
- Yg: y-coordinate of the goal point of the robot

1. Change directory to the root of the directory
